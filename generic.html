									<h1>Bugra</h1>
									<h3>Pronounces as "Boo - Ruh"</h3>
									<p>Jack of all trades, master of none.<br />
									I have an insatiable curiosity for learning and acquiring new abilities.</p>
									
								</header>
								
								<p> I’m a naturally curious person who genuinely enjoys learning new skills and exploring different perspectives on life. That curiosity has shaped who I am: over the years I’ve taught myself and practiced street magic, photography, professional cooking, calligraphy, and other creative hobbies. These experiences weren’t just “interests” for me — they reflect my mindset. When I want to learn something, I commit, practice, improve, and keep going until I’m good at it. I’m disciplined, detail-oriented, and I enjoy the process of getting better.</p>
								<p> Even though I hold a degree in Systems Engineering, my strongest growth happened during my 12-year military career, where I developed solid communication, leadership, and people skills. Working in high-pressure environments taught me how to stay calm, think clearly, and solve problems quickly without spreading stress to others. I’m practical and solution-focused, and I take responsibility seriously. I don’t relax until the job is done properly — not because I’m trying to impress anyone, but because I naturally care about quality and outcomes.</p>
								<p> Over time, I discovered data analytics and data science, and it quickly became a field I genuinely fell in love with. The more I learned, the more I wanted to explore. I enjoy almost everything about working with data: cleaning and preparation, building meaningful visualisations, statistical analysis, writing queries, automation, and developing machine learning models. I’m especially interested in turning messy, complex data into clear insights and useful decision tools. For the last two years, I’ve focused heavily on machine learning, both supervised and unsupervised, and I’m motivated by continuous improvement — learning new methods, testing ideas, and applying them in practical ways.</p>
								<p> Beyond technical capability, I also bring strong and proven management skills. I’m confident managing people, operations, and performance—especially in structured environments where accountability matters. I’m candid and honest in my communication, but always respectful, and that makes me approachable and easy to work with. I believe in teamwork, but I also take personal ownership: I contribute, support others, and step up when things get difficult. I’m loyal to the organisation I work for, highly committed to goals, and consistent in delivering results.</p>
								<p> In short, I combine disciplined leadership and people skills with a deep passion for data and machine learning. Given the opportunity, I’m confident I can bring both strong performance and strong character to your organisation.</p>
