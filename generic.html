									<p>Jack of all trades, master of none.<br />
									I have an insatiable curiosity for learning and acquiring new abilities.</p>

								</header>
								
								<p>I studied Systems Engineering in my Bachelor's but I’ve worked as a ranked officer, specialised on Human Resources & Analysis, in Military for 12 years. I performed various job roles during my career, such as Recruitment Officer, Operation Assessment Officer, ACOS G1 (HR Branch Manager), in national and international environments. I love working with people and data. I have solid experience in personnel management and HR analysis. I feel confident and delighted when performing data cleaning, creating
									relational databases, queries, analysis, and data visualization.  I’ve developed effective presentation skills and made
									comprehensive presentations numerous times. Since I have a curious and expanding personality, recently I’ve realised that I need to shift to another industry other than military. Therefore, I’ve decided to make a career change in my life. My aim is to transfer my passion about data and people, and my experience in the military environment to different industries.
									</p>
								<p> I had always a curiosity for human behaviour, since it's unpredictable even in most certain conditions. Therefore I've read and studied on different aspects of human nature. I've gained obsevative skills to interpret body language along with the speech patterns. To manipulate individual and collective perception, I learned magic tricks, where I had a chance to analyse behaviours. Having worked in international environments provided the opportunity of distinguishing diffences between high/low context cultures and to adjust myself as to them. Since I have positive personality, I've always tried to put a smile on upset faces. I believe in team work. Regarding my role in organization, I can be an efficient gear in system or a motivating leader who steers people to success. Together we stand, divided we fall. </p>
								<p> As it's mentioned above, I love to learn new things. I went to a culinary school to learn how to cook properly. I took photography classes to take the perfect photo each time. Learned to dance, became an amateur vocalist, finished numerous courses on online platforms and still going on. The more I learn, the more I enjoy life.   </p>
